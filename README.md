# Welcome to my ArduinoCodeSnippets repo
## What to expect ##
Here I collect my tried and tested code fragments and/or functions I use in my projects. Often these are helper-functions to simplify tasks or help saving precious microcontroller space by doing repetitive tasks easier.
## What _not_ to expect ##
* Code that works for you regardless what chip/board you use. I try to add as much info and comments to my snippets as I can to help you decide if it'll be working on your platform as well.
* super clean, textbook-style code. I am not a programmer. If something is aweful to your eyes just do a pull request.
